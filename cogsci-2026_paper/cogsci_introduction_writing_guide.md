## Structural Templates

### Template 1: "Ubiquitous Phenomenon → Unexplained Mechanism"

```
1. Open with broad, important human capacity (1-2 sentences)
2. Note its ubiquity/historical significance/real-world stakes
3. State the mechanism gap: "Despite X's importance, little is known about..."
4. Narrow to specific aspect of the phenomenon
5. Articulate the research question
6. State hypothesis + approach
7. Preview findings (optional)
```

**Best for:** Studies investigating fundamental cognitive capacities (perception, memory, communication) where the phenomenon is well-documented but the underlying mechanism is not.

---

### Template 2: "Established View → Recent Challenges → Reconciliation"

```
1. Introduce canonical finding or dominant theoretical position
2. Summarize evidence supporting it
3. Present recent counter-evidence or complications
4. Frame the tension as a puzzle requiring resolution
5. Propose your framework as reconciling the tension
6. State approach and preview findings
```

**Best for:** Studies that reframe classic debates or propose integrative models (e.g., "the fundamental attribution error" → flexible inference).

---

### Template 3: "Vivid Scenario → Abstract Problem → Active Mechanism"

```
1. Open with concrete, relatable scenario (first day of school, meeting a stranger)
2. Extract the general cognitive challenge embedded in that scenario
3. Review what's known about passive/automatic processes
4. Identify gap: active, goal-directed processes underexplored
5. Connect to relevant literature on active learning/information seeking
6. State hypothesis about how active process works
7. Describe paradigm for testing it
```

**Best for:** Studies on social cognition, learning, or decision-making where you want to emphasize agency and goal-directedness.

---

### Template 4: "Domain Transfer"

```
1. Describe well-established computational account in Domain A
2. Note the analogous problem exists in Domain B
3. Identify key differences that make transfer non-trivial
4. State the gap: hasn't been tested in Domain B
5. Describe your approach to testing the transfer
6. Preview what you find (confirms/disconfirms/extends)
```

**Best for:** Studies applying formal models from one domain (physics, language) to another (social cognition, vision).

---

### Template 5: "Striking Contrast Hook"

```
1. Open with surprising real-world contrast (Wordle success vs. Digits failure)
2. Pose the question this contrast raises
3. Survey prior theoretical accounts
4. Note their limitations for explaining the contrast
5. Introduce formal tools from adjacent field
6. Explain why your domain is ideal for applying these tools
7. State goals and approach
```

**Best for:** Studies on preference, engagement, enjoyment, or any phenomenon where natural variation provides a puzzle.

---

## Compelling Writing Moves

### Move 1: The Relatable Scenario Hook

**What it does:** Grounds abstract research question in lived experience; creates immediate identification.

**Examples:**
> "Consider coming home and finding one's roommate baking a dessert..."

> "Children being dropped off for the first day of preschool or set loose at a public playground are initiated into a complex human ritual..."

> "An observer of these exchanges might notice that they typically involve some questions ('Where are you from?') more than others ('How many toes do you have?')."

**Template:** 
```
Consider [common situation]. [Describe two possible interpretations/responses]. 
[Extract the cognitive question this raises].
```

---

### Move 2: The "Yet" Pivot

**What it does:** Creates productive tension between established knowledge and remaining gaps.

**Examples:**
> "Their power to do so arises from their ability to distill complex information... *Critically*, different data visualizations—even when generated from the same underlying dataset—can be used to highlight different kinds of information..."

> "Despite the value of psychological measures... people are rarely seen with pen and clipboard eliciting sliding scale judgments from others..."

**Template:** 
```
Prior work has established X. Yet/However/Despite this, Y remains unknown/overlooked.
```

---

### Move 3: The Stakes Statement

**What it does:** Explains why the reader should care; connects cognitive question to real-world consequences.

**Examples:**
> "The way we account for people's behavior has consequences for how we treat them and make plans with them; *in short*, explanations for others' actions are woven into the fabric of our social lives."

> "Our ability to judge which plot to make depending on what information is most relevant is critical for effective communication."

**Template:** 
```
[Cognitive capacity] has consequences for [downstream behavior/decision/outcome]; 
[restatement emphasizing importance].
```

---

### Move 4: The Puzzle Articulation

**What it does:** Transforms a descriptive observation into a question that demands an answer.

**Examples:**
> "Prior work suggests that people flexibly infer the traits, mental states, and situational pressures... *This poses a puzzle*: how do we decide which of these factors offers the best explanation?"

> "*Confronted with* a range of explanations for others' behavior, *how do we choose the best one?*"

**Template:** 
```
[Summarize what we know]. This poses a puzzle: [frame as how/why question].
```

---

### Move 5: The Conceptual Distinction

**What it does:** Sharpens the intellectual terrain by separating conflated concepts.

**Examples:**
> "There is an important conceptual distinction between the *inferences* we draw about others from their actions, and the *explanations* we provide for those same actions."

> "The difference between hypotheticals and counterfactuals is subtle but important. A hypothetical asks a question about a possible future... A counterfactual asks a question about an alternative present..."

**Template:** 
```
There is an important distinction between X and Y. [Define X]. [Define Y]. 
[Explain why this matters for the current work].
```

---

### Move 6: The Cross-Domain Contrast

**What it does:** Highlights a gap by showing that another field has solved the analogous problem.

**Examples:**
> "Theories of how visual images convey information at different levels of abstraction are comparatively impoverished, *by contrast with* theories of how such semantic hierarchies are encoded in natural language."

> "Coordinated investigation of both comprehension and production has long been a cornerstone of the study of linguistic communication... *while* graph production has rarely been empirically investigated."

**Template:** 
```
In [Domain A], we have rich theories of X. By contrast, in [Domain B], 
such theories are comparatively impoverished/absent.
```

---

### Move 7: The Passive → Active Reframe

**What it does:** Identifies a bias in prior work toward passive processes and proposes active mechanisms as understudied.

**Examples:**
> "Despite the wide array of social cues documented in this work, this approach largely overlooks a critical aspect of human social learning: Rather than merely drawing *passive* inferences... people may *actively seek out* information."

> "This contrast, between more passive learning by observation and *active learning* through intervention or exploration, has been critical to explaining how people acquire useful information..."

**Template:** 
```
Prior work has focused on [passive process]. This overlooks [active process]. 
We propose that...
```

---

### Move 8: The Limitation-Solution Couplet

**What it does:** Precisely diagnoses a methodological limitation in prior work and states how the current study overcomes it.

**Examples:**
> "A key limitation of this prior work is that it has generally restricted their focus to drawings produced at a specific level of abstraction... *To address this limitation*, here we directly manipulate sensory information and representational goals within the same paradigm."

**Template:** 
```
A key limitation of prior work is X. To address this, we Y, allowing us to Z.
```

---

### Move 9: The Formal Tools Import

**What it does:** Brings computational/formal machinery from one area to bear on a new problem.

**Examples:**
> "Research on human problem solving and planning provides formal tools for understanding sequential decision making behavior... these frameworks may explain what makes some problems engaging."

> "Formal tools for evaluating counterfactuals have been immensely important for modern AI. However, the degree to which people rely on counterfactuals for everyday causal reasoning is unclear."

**Template:** 
```
[Field X] provides formal tools for understanding [phenomenon]. 
We apply these tools to [new domain/question].
```

---

### Move 10: The Empirical Hint

**What it does:** Cites suggestive prior evidence that the hypothesis might be correct, building plausibility before the test.

**Examples:**
> "There are reasons to think [hypothesis]. For one, people have reliable intuitions about what makes for a *good question* when first getting to know somebody. Second, recent work has shown that language models provided with transcripts of structured interviews... can predict participants' personality."

**Template:** 
```
There are reasons to think [hypothesis]. First, [evidence 1]. Second, [evidence 2]. 
In the current work, we test this directly.
```

## Small Rhetorical Tricks & Elegant Phrasing

### Sentence-Level Devices

#### The Clarifying Restatement
Restate the point more crisply after a semicolon, using "in short" or "in other words."

> "...explanations for others' actions are woven into the fabric of our social lives; *in short*, how we explain behavior matters."

> "...these represent plausible causes; *in other words*, explaining others' actions requires selecting from among competing causes."

---

#### The Italicized Key Term
Use italics to introduce technical terms or highlight conceptual distinctions.

> "...observers must decide whether to place the cause *within* the actor or in contextual factors *external* to the actor."

> "...people may *actively seek out* information about what they are like."

---

#### The "Ranging from... to..." Construction
Shows breadth and scope by spanning extremes.

> "...flexible expression of meanings across different levels of visual abstraction, *ranging from* detailed drawings of specific objects *to* sparse drawings that communicate information about basic-level categories."

> "...across a range of contexts, *from* birthday parties *to* college dormitories *to* starting a new job."

---

#### The Historical Sweep
Establishes significance through temporal depth.

> "...has been a central focus in social psychology *for nearly 100 years*."

> "Drawing *predates the invention of writing* and is pervasive across many cultures."

> "*From* etchings on cave walls *to* modern digital displays..."

---

#### The Tricolon
Lists of three create rhythm and suggest comprehensiveness.

> "...to predict their behavior, decide whether to trust them, and determine whether we might get along."

> "...novelty, complexity, or uncertainty."

---

#### The "Not Only... But Also" Expansion
Acknowledges one aspect before pivoting to the more important one.

> "People *not only* consider what someone else did, *but also* compare what actually happened with what would have happened..."

---

#### The Strategic Hedge
Signals appropriate epistemic humility while maintaining authority.

> "...these results *provide suggestive evidence* for conditions in which..."

> "...people *appear to* use mental simulation..."

> "...*may* explain what makes some problems engaging."

---

#### The "Whether" Construction
Frames empirical questions with precision.

> "...we explore *whether* in this socially evaluative setting, causal judgments are also better explained by counterfactuals rather than hypotheticals."

> "...to test the degree to which these judgments reflect sensitivity to *whether* other people are actually able to answer that question."

---

### Transition & Flow Devices

#### The "Here, we..." Pivot
Signals the transition from literature review to contribution.

> "*Here*, we investigate the cognitive and task constraints that enable such flexible expression..."

> "*In the current work*, we hypothesize that..."

> "*Here*, we build on this work by looking into situations in which..."

---

#### The "One reason for this is..." Explanation
Diagnoses why a problem exists before solving it.

> "*One reason for this* is the sheer diversity of explanations for others' actions."

---

#### The "While X, Y" Concession
Acknowledges prior work while pivoting to the gap.

> "*While* initially developed to explain behavior in laboratory tasks rather than naturally occurring playful behavior, these frameworks may explain..."

> "*While* no single piece of information is sufficient to describe what someone is like, we have the impression that..."

---

#### The Question as Section Pivot
Uses italicized rhetorical question to crystallize the core inquiry.

> "*Confronted with a range of explanations for others' behavior, how do we choose the best one?*"

> "*How do we arrive at this knowledge over the course of interaction?*"

---

### Structural Phrasing

#### The "Some X... Others Y" Contrast
Sets up alternative possibilities or theoretical positions.

> "*Some* have argued that counterfactual simulation is essential... [but] *others* have proposed that explanations may instead recruit simpler proxies..."

---

#### The Parenthetical Example
Adds concreteness without disrupting flow.

> "...involve some questions ('Where are you from?') more than others ('How many toes do you have?')."

> "...usually referred to as 'openness,' 'conscientiousness,' 'extraversion,' 'agreeableness,' and 'neuroticism'."

---

#### The "Despite X, Y Remains" Gap Statement
Efficiently identifies what's missing.

> "*Despite* drawing's importance as a technology for expressing human knowledge, the underlying cognitive mechanisms underpinning our ability to produce such varied drawings *are relatively unknown*."

> "*Despite* the importance of such technologies, *little is known* about how the human mind is capable of using them."

---

#### The "X has been/is Y; Z is less understood" Two-Part Structure
Establishes what's known, then pivots to the unknown.

> "How we explain the behavior of others *has been* a central focus in social psychology for nearly 100 years, *yet* incorporating prior findings into AI and applying them to naturalistic scenarios *remains a challenge*."

---

#### The "Just as... so too..." Analogy
Draws parallels across domains.

> "*Just as* we can infer mental states, traits, or important situational factors on the basis of others' actions, all of these represent plausible causes that we might use to explain their behavior."

---

### Elegance Tricks

#### The Two-Clause Zoom
Start broad, then narrow within a single sentence using a colon or dash.

> "In these settings, one of the core challenges is learning about the people around us: when interacting with somebody for the first time, we want to know what they are like."

---

#### The "Critically" / "Importantly" Insertion
Signals that the next clause is the key point.

> "*Critically*, different data visualizations—even when generated from the same underlying dataset—can be used to highlight different kinds of information."

---

#### The Inverted Expectation
Set up a common assumption, then subvert it.

> "...people are rarely seen with pen and clipboard eliciting sliding scale judgments from others, even in contexts where the goal is to get to know them."

---

#### The Em-Dash Insertion
Adds clarification or dramatic emphasis mid-sentence.

> "...some of the most significant inventions in human history include technologies that externalize our thoughts in visual form—*and perhaps the most basic and versatile of these is drawing*."

---

## Meta-Principles

### 1. Funnel Structure
Move from broad → specific → your contribution → preview of findings. Each paragraph should narrow the focus.

### 2. Tension is Generative
The best introductions create productive tension—between views, between domains, between what we know and what we don't—that the paper resolves.

### 3. Concrete Before Abstract
Lead with examples, scenarios, or cases before extracting the general principle. Readers remember stories.

### 4. Mechanism > Description
Frame your contribution as explaining *how* or *why*, not just *what*. Mechanism claims are more interesting than descriptive claims.

### 5. The "So What" Test
Every literature review paragraph should end with a gap, limitation, or puzzle that motivates the next move. If a paragraph doesn't earn its place, cut it.

### 6. One Central Question
The introduction should make clear what single question the paper addresses. All literature review serves to motivate that question—nothing more.

### 7. Earned Complexity
Don't introduce theoretical machinery or jargon until you've shown the reader why they need it. Make them want the framework before giving it to them.

### 8. The Implicit Promise
Your introduction makes a promise to the reader: "If you keep reading, I will answer this question." Make sure your paper delivers on that promise.
