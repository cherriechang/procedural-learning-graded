learning

\section{Introductino}\label{introductino}

How many times have you typed ``form'' instead of ``from''? Or ended a
word with ``-tino'' instead of ``-tion'', perhaps even in an important,
embarrassingly glaring context? The typos we make are not random; they
reflect the statistical patterns in the language we use. Experienced
typists learn that some keystroke sequences are highly probable, causing
their fingers to automatically perform ones like ``for'' mistakenly, or
perform them so quickly they slip up, like in the case of ``-tino''. Yet
typists cannot consciously report these probabilities or articulate
their finger movements at the speed of execution - this knowledge is
expressed in the automatic motor performance of typing, not in conscious
awareness. This implicit form of learning, where statistical
regularities are unconsciously acquired and expressed as behavior rather
than declared knowledge, is called procedural learning
(\citet{squire_memory_2004}, \citet{nissen_attentional_1987}).

Procedural learning is not limited to typing. It underlies skill
acquisition across many domains, from proprioceptive skills like riding
a bike to perceptual-cognitive skills like reading mirrored text
(\citet{kassubek_changes_2001}). More recently, procedural learning has
been proposed to support increasingly diverse and sophisticated
abilities, notably grammar acquisition in language
(\citet{ullman_specific_2005}, \citet{lammertink_statistical_2017},
\citet{lum_procedural_2014}, \citet{kidd_individual_2016}). These
proposals invite closer scrutiny of its scalability: can the procedural
learning system handle the large-scale, complex statistical structures
that characterize domains like grammar? Consider a suggestive historical
case: while QWERTY keyboards (26 letter keys) enabled fluent touch
typing through procedural learning, Chinese typewriters (trays of 2,000+
characters) never achieved comparable automaticity and were eventually
abandoned (for QWERTY keyboards, among others!)
(\citet{mullaney_chinese_2017}). This raises a fundamental question:
does procedural learning fail beyond a certain level of statistical
complexity and state space size? As a first step toward answering these
questions, we examine whether procedural learning tracks fine-grained
statistical patterns - both the predictability of individual transitions
and the uncertainty of different states - and how it scales across state
space sizes from 4 to 8 positions.

The primary method for measuring procedural learning has been the Serial
Reaction Time Task (SRTT; \citet{nissen_attentional_1987}). In the SRTT,
participants respond to stimuli appearing in one of four positions on
screen using key presses. Unbeknownst to them, the sequence of positions
follows a deterministic pattern. Over time, reaction times (RT) decrease
for patterned trials relative to random trials, demonstrating procedural
learning of the key press sequence corresponding to the positional
sequence's deterministic pattern. While the SRTT provided early evidence
for procedural learning, it suffers from a critical confound:
participants often develop explicit awareness of the sequence, making it
difficult to isolate implicit procedural learning effects
(\citet{song_perceptual_2008}, \citet{lustig_transition_2022}). This has
contributed to low test-retest reliability
(\citet{west_procedural_2018}, \citet{oliveira_reliability_2023}).

The Alternating Serial Reaction Time Task (ASRT;
\citet{howard_jr_age_1997}) addressed these issues by introducing a
probabilistic design. In ASRT, deterministic (d) and random (r) trials
alternate (e.g., d-r-d-r), resulting in positional sequences with two
levels of frequency (high vs.~low). This probabilistic design minimizes
explicit awareness and dramatically improves reliability
(\citet{farkas_complexity_2024}, \citet{oliveira_reliability_2023}).
However, a key limitation of ASRT is that its bimodal frequency
distribution represents an overtly simplistic statistical structure,
lacking the graded frequency distributions found in real-world domains
like language. Finally, across both SRTT and ASRT, experiment designs
have mostly tested sequences with four possible positions (e.g.,
\citet{janacsek_best_2012}, \citet{hedenius_grammar_2011}), despite
real-world domains where procedural learning is implicated often
involving far larger state spaces. Whether procedural learning can track
graded statistical structures, and whether it scales to larger state
spaces, remains untested.

Here, we introduce a new paradigm that retains ASRT's probabilistic
design but introduces a graded statistical structure with a smooth
continuum of transition probabilities. We construct transition matrices
to generate positional sequences where each position has a different
entropy, ranging from deterministic (low entropy) to uniformly
distributed (high entropy). We also vary the number of positions (4, 5,
6, 7, 8) to test whether procedural learning scales with state space
size. This allows us to ask: (1) Are learners sensitive to fine-grained
differences in transition probabilities (surprisal) and state-level
uncertainty (entropy), beyond simple high vs.~low frequency contrasts?
(2) Do learning trajectories change as the number of positions
increases? Across 219 participants, we find evidence that procedural
learning is sensitive to graded statistical structure, and that this
sensitivity emerges early and strengthens over time. These results
suggest that procedural learning is more flexible than prior paradigms
can reveal, with implications for understanding how procedural learning
operates in naturalistic environments.

\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

We make the following predictions: First, if participants are learning
the statistical structure and not merely practicing motor responses,
trial-level RT and accuracy will be predicted by surprisal---the
negative log probability of the observed transition---such that
higher-surprisal (less predictable) transitions elicit slower and less
accurate responses (H1). Second, previous positional entropy---the
entropy of the transition distribution from the previous position---will
modulate performance independently, with higher-entropy (more uncertain)
previous positions leading to slower and less accurate responses (H2).
We further predict that surprisal effects will be stronger following
low-entropy positions, where predictions are more confident and
prediction errors more costly (surprisal × entropy interaction). Third,
these effects will be attenuated as the number of positions increases,
reflecting greater difficulty in learning more complex statistical
structures (H3). Note that number of positions is confounded with
entropy range in our design, so H3 effects may partially reflect
differences in entropy distributions across conditions.

\section{Method}\label{method}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We recruited 251 participants (133 female, 118 male) to complete a
web-based experiment using the online crowd-sourcing platform Prolific,
screening for participants with an approval rating above 95\% from
previous studies and limiting participation to be on desktop or laptop
computers. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 75 years (\(\mu\)=35.6,
\(\sigma\)=11.9), representing 32 nationalities and 20 primary
languages. Participants were compensated at \$12.00 per hour, with
median completion time varying by condition (\textasciitilde20-40
minutes). All participants provided informed consent prior to the
experiment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
the MGH Institute of Health Professions.

\subsection{Probabilistic Serial Reaction Time
Task}\label{probabilistic-serial-reaction-time-task}

Like other serial reaction time task designs, our experiment tasks
participants to respond to a visual stimulus that appears in one of
several evenly-spaced positions on screen as quickly and accurately as
possible by pressing a corresponding key on the keyboard. In our
implementation, this visual stimulus is a mole garbed in a bright red
bib and matching sunglasses (Figure~\ref{fig-example-trial-screen}); and
a schematic of each position-to-keyboard mapping for each condition is
shown in (Table). Participants were evenly divided into 5 groups of 50
per condition, with the conditions differing in the number of positions
(4, 5, 6, 7, 8) the mole can appear in.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{"../assets/example-trial-screen.png"}

}

\caption{\label{fig-example-trial-screen}An example trial screen in the
8-position condition of the experiment}

\end{figure}%

A participant is first given a text-based tutorial accompanied by an
animated demonstration on which key to press in response to each
position, then instructed to work through a set of practice trials where
each position is visited twice in random order. After the practice
section, the participant moves on to complete 20 blocks of trials, each
separated with a self-paced break. Each block consists of 10 trials per
position. This design choice results in longer blocks for conditions
with more positions, but ensures each position is visited an equal
number of times on average across conditions. In both practice and main
trials, participants are given feedback on correctness via a pop-up
short message (a checkmark vs.~``Try again!'' + an error tone), and
allowed to retry each failed trial until they respond correctly.
Following standard SRTT protocol, there is also a 120ms
response-stimulus interval (RSI) between trials {[}CITE{]}. We find
during piloting that allowing retries, combined with the 120ms RSI,
prevents participants from making compensatory errors, where they
unintentionally press the wrong key in the next trial in an attempt to
correct their current trial. We record response time, keyboard response
and correctness for each trial. After each block, participants are given
adaptive feedback based on their accuracy and speed. At the end of the
experiment, participants complete a brief questionnaire probing their
explicit awareness of any patterns in the mole's appearances (Table).

In addition to our dapper mole, a number of design choices were made to
facilitate participant understanding and engagement. During the practice
phase, each position on screen is labelled with its corresponding key
character (e.g.~``A'', ``S'', ``D'') to help familiarize participants
with the keyboard mappings. These key labels disappear in the main
trials to prevent explicitly encoding of the sequence of positions via
their character labels, but reappear during retry of failed trials. To
make the correspondence between the positions on screen and keyboard
keys as automatic and intuitive as possible, we chose to use
conventional QWERTY-based finger layouts for the key mappings across
conditions (Table). We found during piloting that while this decision
helped reduce cognitive load from learning novel finger placements, the
larger gap between keys ``F'' and ``J'' on the keyboard introduced a
discrepancy between the evenly-spaced on-screen positions and the
unevenly spaced keyboard keys. This made participants more prone to
making errors in the positions towards the middle of the screen compared
to those on the outer edges, especially when number of positions
increases {[}TODO: maybe run stats on pilot to find this effect{]}; and
was not mitigated by shifting either hand's placement to close the extra
gap, because the positions were still corresponding half to one hand and
half to the other. After further piloting testing different visual aids,
we settled on adding two hands visually to the bottom of the screen,
each finger aligned with its target position (Figure). We received
verbal feedback that this visual aid helped participants better map the
spatial layout of the on-screen positions to their corresponding keys.
Lastly, the visual design of the ``positions'' on screen mimicked blank
3D keyboard keys that light up in pink when the mole appears on top, and
look visibly ``pressed down'' when the participant presses the
corresponding keyboard key. This design choice links the on-screen
positions diegetically to the physical keyboard keys to maximally reduce
mental distance between the two. This is important to enforce as much
learning via implicit motor memory as possible, rather than via
visual-spatial memory of the on-screen positions.

\subsection{Transition Matrices}\label{transition-matrices}

Our experiment deviates from other serial reaction time tasks in how the
sequence of positions and its probabilistic structure is constructed. In
each run of the experiment, we use a first-order Markov process to
generate the sequence of positions the mole appears in. This process is
defined by a transition matrix, where each entry in the matrix defines
the probability of transitioning from one position to another. We
designed five different transition matrices of sizes 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7,
and 8x8 respectively corresponding to the five conditions in our
experiment. These ``original'' matrices were constructed to have graded
and increasing levels of entropy across rows, such that position 1 has
lowest entropy-having the most predictable next-position-transitions,
followed by the second, with the last position, position n, having
highest entropy. For example, in the 4x4 matrix, position 1 has a high
probability (\textasciitilde0.97) of transitioning to position 2, a low
probability (\textasciitilde0.03) of transitioning to position 1, and
never transitions to position 3 or 4; while position 4 has a more
uniform distribution of transition probabilities to all other positions
(to 1: \textasciitilde(0.39), to 2: \textasciitilde(0.03), to 3:
\textasciitilde(0.24), to 4: \textasciitilde(0.35)). This gives rise to
a gradient of entropy values across the positions, which results in a
richer, more varied distributed statistical structure underlying the
sequence of positions the mole appears in, allowing us to investigate
how the procedural learning system differentially picks up varying
levels of predictability in a given statistical structure.

Several design criteria/constraints were imposed on the construction of
these original transition matrices. First, these matrices had to be
doubly stochastic to ensure uniform visitation to each position over
time, preventing confounding effects from position frequency on
learning. Second, self-transitions (e.g.~position 1 to position 1)
should have near-zero probabilities to reduce data loss, as data from
repeated trials have been historically thrown out from analysis in
serial reaction time tasks to prevent confounding motor effects from
repeating the same keypress {[}CITE{]}. Third, the graded entropy levels
across the positions should translate to graded probabilities across
bigrams as well, as having more fine-grained, distributed levels of
transition probabilities is our experiment's key distinction from other
SRTT tasks, such as the ASRT paradigm which only has 2 levels of trigram
probability. Fourth, the increase in entropy across positions
(i.e.~rows) should be significant between one another and as linear as
possible to ensure smooth a smooth gradient with meaningfully distinct
levels in predictability across positions.

Strictly satisfying all these constraints at once turned out to be not
only non-trivial, but mathematically impossible for our range of
n\_positions (i.e.~matrix sizes), so we wrote an optimization algorithm
that explores the candidate space for each matrix size, treating these
constraints as soft penalties to find a global minimum of the total
constraint violation, balancing trade-offs among the competing
constraints.

The five original matrices we constructed using this algorithm had these
properties: 1) near fully doubly stochastic---all row and column sums
sum to 1 (±0.0001) {[}TODO: consider not hardcoding{]}; 2) approach a
uniform stationary distribution after 7 timesteps {[}TODO: consider not
hardcoding{]} where the stationary visitation for each state (position)
are within 0.001 of each other; 3) had a graded entropy structure across
states---each matrix had a positional entropy range of 0.061-0.181 bits
for position 1 (\(\mu\)=0.107, \(\sigma\)=0.048), and 1.695-2.835 bits
for position n (\(\mu\)=2.319, \(\sigma\)=0.451). Within a matrix each
position increases in entropy from the previous by 0.295-0.699 bits
(\(\mu\)=0.442, \(\sigma\)=0.085); and 4) avoided self loops as much as
possible---all of the matrices had \textless0.08 {[}TODO: consider not
hardcoding{]} probabilities in the left diagonal up until the last two
positions. Within each matrix size condition, all participants
experience the same underlying entropy gradient across positions, but
the mapping between screen positions and entropy levels is randomized
through a double permutation procedure that shuffles the original matrix
(of that size) using the same random permutation. This preserves the
statistical properties of the original matrix---transition probabilities
and entropy values---but decouples entropy levels from specific screen
positions. The position sequence for each participant is subsequently
generated using their individual shuffled transition matrix, so the
sequence each participant experiences is different both within and
between matrix size conditions.

\section{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}

\subsection{Variables and Exclusion
Criteria}\label{variables-and-exclusion-criteria}

The main independent variables are surprisal and previous positional
entropy. Surprisal is defined as the negative log probability of the
actual next-position given the current position {[}TODO: math{]},
derived from the transition matrix used to generate the sequence for
that participant. Previous positional entropy is defined as the Shannon
entropy of the transition probabilities from the previous position, also
derived from the transition matrix {[}TODO: math{]}. Both surprisal and
previous positional entropy are mean-centered within each matrix size
condition to facilitate interpretation of main effects and interactions
in subsequent models. We also create a binary variable indicating
whether the current position is a repetition of the previous position
(i.e.~self-transition). This variable is included as a covariate in
subsequent models to control for potential motor effects from repeating
the same keypress.

The main dependent variables are response time (RT) and accuracy
(proportion of correct responses) on non-practice/main trials. Incorrect
trials, trials with RT \textgreater1000ms, and trials with RTs greater
than 3 median absolute deviations above the participant's median RT
(outliers) are excluded. On the participant level, participants with
overall accuracy below 85\%, median RT \textgreater1000ms, or with
outliers making up more than 30\% of total trials are excluded from
analysis. We also discard data from the first trial of each block to
account for blocks being implicitly treated as ``restarts'' and not
following an existing probability distribution by participants. RTs are
log-transformed to reduce skewness.

\subsection{Modeling Approach}\label{modeling-approach}

We use linear mixed effects regression (LMER) to model log-transformed
RTs and generalized linear mixed effects regression (GLMER) with a
binomial link function to model accuracy. Models are fit using the
\texttt{lmerTest} package in R. We first test for the learning effect
across blocks (H0), then examine the effects of surprisal and previous
positional entropy (H1 \& H2) in the final block, pruning effects where
applicable to find the best-fitting effects structure before analyzing
learning trajectories across blocks, and finally test for moderation by
number of positions/matrix size(H3).

Models are initially fit with the maximal random effects structure
supported by the design: random intercepts for participant and position,
and random slopes for surprisal, previous positional entropy, their
interaction, and position repetition by participant. Where maximal
models fail to converge, we use bounded linear mixed models
(\texttt{blmer}/\texttt{bglmer}) as a first remedy. If singularity
persists, we iteratively simplify the random effects structure, removing
random slopes one at a time and retaining the most complex structure
that converges without singularity. Among converging models, we select
the one with the lowest AIC.

For H1 and H2, we first establish the fixed effects structure using only
the final block of trials, then extend to learning trajectories across
blocks. Starting from a base model including surprisal, previous
positional entropy, their interaction, and repetition as fixed effects
(with the selected random effects structure), we use AIC-based model
comparison to prune fixed effects. We first test whether repetition is
significant by comparing the base model against one in which it is
removed; if removing it does not increase AIC, we drop it from the base
model. We then test whether the interaction term between surprisal and
previous positional entropy is significant by comparing the current base
model against one in which the interaction term is removed. If the
interaction is not significant, we test each main effect individually by
comparing models that omit surprisal or previous positional entropy as
main effects. An effect is retained if removing it increases AIC.
